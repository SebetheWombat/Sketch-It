#Sketch-It

Try making designs by dragging your mouse over the sketch area. The sketch pad starts as a 16X16 box grid. You can create finer or more pixelated looking sketches by changing the number of boxes in the grid.  

Just for fun hit the rainbow button before you start to draw and see what happens. :)
